# VS - Interactive Frontend Project

## Data Dashboard Creation
#### Frontend-only website
Build a data dashboard that visualizes a dataset of your choice
Your data can be stored locally (e.g., in a js file) or sourced from an API
Visualise your data using D3.js and dc.js

******
### Guidelines

[ ] Create a Single-Page Application (SPA).

[ ] Incorporate links or buttons to allow your user to navigate the site and reset/control the site functionality.

[ ] Use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.

[ ] Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the site on different screen sizes and browsers. Please note that if you are building a data dashboard, only your chart containers are expected to be responsive. Charts using D3.js are not responsive as they are designed for desktop or large-screen viewing.

[ ] Write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.

[ ] The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.

[ ] You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your website's functionality works well.

[x] Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.

[ ] Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.
