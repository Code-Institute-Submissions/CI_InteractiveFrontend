# VS - Interactive Frontend Project

## Data Dashboard Creation
#### Frontend-only website
Build a data dashboard that visualizes a dataset of your choice
Your data can be stored locally (e.g., in a js file) or sourced from an API
Visualise your data using D3.js and dc.js

### Guidelines

[x] Create a Single-Page Application (SPA).

[x] Incorporate links or buttons to allow your user to navigate the site and reset/control the site functionality.

[x] Use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.

[x] Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the site on different screen sizes and browsers. Please note that if you are building a data dashboard, only your chart containers are expected to be responsive. Charts using D3.js are not responsive as they are designed for desktop or large-screen viewing.

[x] Write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.

[x] The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.

[ ] You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your website's functionality works well.

[x] Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.

[ ] Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.
##Testing
Jasmine: useful when input is given, DOM generated  & retruns a value -- this project does not give me the opportunity to use it

## What the project does and the need that it fulfills
## Functionality of the project 
## Technologies used 
```
D3.js, Dc.js, Boostrap, JQuery
```
Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need.
